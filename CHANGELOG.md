* **coroutines:** one time initialised lazy proxies will be always returned on context switch, even when the initialisation did not finish ([2a30be7](https://github.com/symfony-swoole/swoole-bundle/commit/2a30be731a35301d13c2953e4a6deccc3cddbffb))

* **coroutines:** service resetter reevaluation needs to run  after RemoveUnusedDefinitionsPass so the resetter can get only existing services and instantiate them on first usage ([4972ff3](https://github.com/symfony-swoole/swoole-bundle/commit/4972ff31a70652ae197b25e52f0d32ca6f3f16b1))

* **performance:** wrapped entity managers are eager by default, the service pool proxy is the lazy layer ([7ccbebe](https://github.com/symfony-swoole/swoole-bundle/commit/7ccbebe54b4e12dbc060687567590e0d184e38f6))
* **php-cs-fixer:** returned back the blank_line_between_import_groups rule ([b2c6480](https://github.com/symfony-swoole/swoole-bundle/commit/b2c64804c2242c287b77107e3c8738edc12d49ac))

* **proxifier:** coroutine proxifier - proxified services' service pools are shared or non-shared based on the proxified service shared flag, together with the service proxy ([c4c6006](https://github.com/symfony-swoole/swoole-bundle/commit/c4c6006ff6d6fa7571061911a15d38d26e8b65d3))
